            <h2>Sarcoma Overview</h2>
            <p>Sarcoma is a type of cancer that mainly develops in <strong>connective tissue</strong>. It is often
                separated into two categories, <em>bone</em> and <em>soft tissue</em> sarcomas.</p>
            <h5>Cancer Overview</h5>
            <p>Your body is made of billions of tiny cells, and every day, millions of them have to copy
                the equivalent of a million pages of information.
                Inevitably, there are a lot of mistakes. Most of the mistakes are fixed immediately, but sometimes
                they can't, or are just missed. In this case, the cell will most often undergo apoptosis, whether
                directed to by its own internal mechanisms, or by the immune system.</p>
            <p>If all these system fail, and the damage activates some specific systems in the cell, in can start to
                grow rapidly, using resources that other cells need, becoming cancer.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Common Sarcoma Subtypes:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ewing Sarcoma</strong>: Affects bones or soft tissues, mostly in children and young
                        adults, caused by a genetic fusion leading to uncontrolled growth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dermatofibrosarcoma</strong>: Develops in the skin's middle layer due to a genetic
                        alteration that causes abnormal cell growth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Synovial Sarcoma</strong>: Characterized by a genetic change disrupting normal cell
                        function, often affecting tissues around joints.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor</strong>: Linked to gene changes in cell
                        signaling, leading to excessive cell growth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor</strong>: Arises from a genetic change between
                        chromosomes, causing overproduction of a growth-promoting protein.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Liposarcoma</strong>: Involves increased genes on chromosome 12, leading to
                        uncontrolled growth.

            <h2>Treatment Options for most Sarcomas</h2>
            <h5 class="card-title">Surgery</h5>
            <p>Surgery is the primary treatment for non-metastatic sarcomas and is often considered the most
                effective approach to achieve a cure.
                A small variety of other drugs are available to minimize future occurrences.</p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Radiation Therapy</h5>
            <p>While radiation therapy is not frequently employed, it can play a role in some sarcoma cases.
                It is typically administered either before or after surgery to assist in shrinking the tumor,
                facilitating its removal, or to eliminate any remaining cancerous cells.</p>
            <p>If surgery is not a viable option, radiation can be used as an alternate form of treatment.</p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Chemotherapy</h5>
            <p>Chemotherapy is also infrequently employed, but can be effective in certain cases.</p>
            <p>Traditional chemotherapy shares similar roles to radiation therapy,
                in that it is seldom the main form of treatment, but can be used to assist surgery.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Why is cancer so hard to cure?</h5>
                <p>One of the main reasons is that 'cancer' is not just a single disease, but a broad label encompassing
                    over 200 major types and several hundreds of variations.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Another important reason is that cancer looks too much like you.</p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Cancer cells, on the outside, look very similar to your own cells (because they are, really), so
                    any drug or treatment that kills cancer cells will inevitably kill your own cells as well.
                    The only major outward signs that a cell is cancerous is rapid division, as well as the cell
                    being stressed and producing abnormal proteins (some proteins only exist in your cells when
                    you are a young baby).</p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    There are some treatments that can hamper and kill cancer-like cells, by targeting the cells
                    that are in the middle of reproducing. However, this also targets fast-dividing cells, such as
                    hair, blood production, and major parts of the immune system.</p>
